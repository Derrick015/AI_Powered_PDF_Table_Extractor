# ðŸŽ¯ Deployment Issue Resolution Summary

## Problems Identified & Fixed

### âœ… **1. Missing API Key (FIXED)**
**Problem:** The OPENAI_API_KEY environment variable was not present in your deployed pods.

**Root Cause:** 
- Your deployment guide said to create secret named `llmops-secrets` with key `OPEN_AI_KEY`
- But your `kubernetes-deployment.yaml` expected `ai-powered-pdf-table-extractor-secrets` with key `OPENAI_API_KEY`
- This mismatch meant the pods couldn't access the OpenAI API

**Fix Applied:**
1. Updated `GCP deployment.md` to use the correct secret name and key
2. You need to run this in Cloud Shell:
```bash
kubectl create secret generic ai-powered-pdf-table-extractor-secrets \
  --from-literal=OPENAI_API_KEY="your-actual-openai-key"
kubectl rollout restart deployment ai-powered-pdf-table-extractor
```

### âœ… **2. Streamlit StopException Errors (FIXED)**
**Problem:** When processing files, you saw errors like:
```
streamlit.runtime.scriptrunner_utils.exceptions.StopException
Task exception was never retrieved
```

**Root Cause:** 
- The app was updating Streamlit UI elements (`status_text.text()`, `progress_bar.progress()`) from within async tasks
- When users navigated away or the page refreshed during processing, Streamlit raised `StopException` to halt execution
- These exceptions weren't being caught, causing error logs

**Fix Applied:**
- Added try-except blocks around all UI updates in async tasks (lines 356-360, 435-439, 449-453)
- Now the app gracefully handles StopExceptions and continues processing
- Error logs are eliminated while maintaining functionality

**Files Modified:**
- `app.py` - Added exception handling for UI updates in async context

## How to Deploy the Fix

### Step 1: Commit and push your changes
```bash
git add app.py "GCP deployment.md"
git commit -m "Fix: Handle StopException in async tasks and correct secret configuration"
git push origin main
```

### Step 2: Rebuild and deploy to GKE

If you're using CI/CD (GitLab/GitHub Actions), it should automatically rebuild and deploy.

**Or manually:**

```bash
# Connect to your cluster
gcloud container clusters get-credentials YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME --region YOUR_REGION --project deron-innovations

# Build and push new Docker image
docker build -t us-central1-docker.pkg.dev/deron-innovations/ai-powered-pdf-table-extractor-repo/ai-powered-pdf-table-extractor:latest .
docker push us-central1-docker.pkg.dev/deron-innovations/ai-powered-pdf-table-extractor-repo/ai-powered-pdf-table-extractor:latest

# Update the deployment
kubectl rollout restart deployment ai-powered-pdf-table-extractor

# Wait for rollout to complete
kubectl rollout status deployment ai-powered-pdf-table-extractor
```

### Step 3: Verify the fix
```bash
# Get pod name
POD_NAME=$(kubectl get pods -l app=ai-powered-pdf-table-extractor -o jsonpath='{.items[0].metadata.name}')

# Watch logs
kubectl logs -f $POD_NAME
```

Upload a test PDF and verify:
- âœ… No more StopException errors in logs
- âœ… Files process successfully
- âœ… Clean log output showing:
  - "Starting Tabulify PDF application"
  - "Converting PDF page X to base64 image"
  - "HTTP Request: POST https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions"
  - "Processing tables to DataFrame"

## What You Should See Now

### âœ… Before Fix (Errors):
```
ERROR - Task exception was never retrieved
future: <Task finished name='Task-242' coro=<process_pages.<locals>.process_one_page()>
exception=StopException()>
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/app/app.py", line 355, in process_one_page
    status_text.text(f"Processing page {page_no + 1}...")
...
streamlit.runtime.scriptrunner_utils.exceptions.StopException
```

### âœ… After Fix (Clean):
```
INFO - Starting Tabulify PDF application
INFO - Using PAGE_MAX_CONCURRENCY=4
INFO - Converting PDF page 1 to base64 image. DPI=500, Format=png
INFO - Finished converting page to base64.
INFO - HTTP Request: POST https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions "HTTP/1.1 200 OK"
INFO - num_tables: 1
INFO - Processing tables to DataFrame for page 1
INFO - Completed processing tables to DataFrame for page 1. Total tables extracted: 1
INFO - Writing output to Excel
INFO - Excel file writing complete.
```

## Testing Checklist

After deploying, test the following:

- [ ] Upload a small single-page PDF with one table
- [ ] Verify processing completes successfully
- [ ] Download the output Excel/CSV file
- [ ] Verify table data is correct
- [ ] Check pod logs for any errors
- [ ] Try uploading a multi-page PDF
- [ ] Try navigating away during processing (should not cause errors in logs)
- [ ] Try refreshing page during processing (should not cause errors in logs)

## Additional Notes

### Why This Happened
1. **Secret Mismatch:** Documentation inconsistency between guide and deployment config
2. **Async UI Updates:** Streamlit's architecture doesn't expect UI updates from background async tasks that continue after user navigation

### Prevention for Future
1. Always verify secret names match between deployment YAML and creation commands
2. Test by checking `printenv` in pods: `kubectl exec -it <pod-name> -- printenv`
3. When using async tasks in Streamlit, always wrap UI updates in try-except blocks
4. Monitor logs during initial deployment to catch configuration issues early

## Need More Help?

If issues persist:
1. Check logs: `kubectl logs -f <pod-name>`
2. Verify secret: `kubectl get secret ai-powered-pdf-table-extractor-secrets -o yaml`
3. Check pod status: `kubectl describe pod <pod-name>`
4. Verify OpenAI API key is valid and has credits

**Status:** âœ… Both issues identified and fixed!
**Next Action:** Deploy the updated code and test
